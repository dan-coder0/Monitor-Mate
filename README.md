# Monitor Mate - Production Ready

A comprehensive React Native application for monitoring mobile app security, permissions, and usage patterns.

## ‚úÖ Status

- **Real data validation**: Comprehensive data validation and sanitization
- **Error handling**: Production-grade error boundaries and fallbacks  
- **Service monitoring**: Built-in service health monitoring
- **Platform-ready**: Requires native module implementation for full functionality

## üöÄ Quick Start

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide.

### Development Setup

1. **Start Metro**:
```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

2. **Run the application**:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

- **App Categorization**: Automatic categorization of applications  
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive security risk evaluation
- **Service Status**: Built-in monitoring and diagnostic tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- **App List Retrieval**: Requires native `InstalledApps` module
- **App Details**: Detailed app information from system
- **Usage Statistics**: App usage time and patterns

## üì± What to Expect

- Full app monitoring functionality
- Real app data from device
- Complete security analysis
- All features operational

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All analysis performed on-device
- **No External APIs**: Permission analysis uses local database

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
